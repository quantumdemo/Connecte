**Headline:** Stop scattering your links. Start converting your audience.

**Body:**

Excited to introduce **Connecte**, the open-source Link-in-Bio platform I've been working on! 🚀

As a creator or entrepreneur, your digital presence is everything. You have a blog, a portfolio, a shop, social channels, and more. But you only get one link in your bio.

Connecte solves that. It lets you create a beautiful, personalized landing page to house all your important links in one place.

But it's more than just a link hub. With Connecte, you can:

✅ **Own Your Brand:** Create a public profile (`yourname.com/@yourbrand`) that reflects your identity.
✅ **Track Your Impact:** Get detailed analytics on which links are getting the most clicks, helping you understand your audience better.
✅ **Monetize Your Content:** Add a "Support Me" link to receive payments directly from your followers.
✅ **Go Premium:** Unlock powerful features like exclusive themes, unlimited links, and advanced analytics to take your brand to the next level.

Built with Flask and powered by Paystack for secure subscriptions, Connecte is designed for serious creators who want to grow their audience and business.

Hey everyone! 👋 I'm so excited to share a project I've been working on called **Connecte**!

You know how you can only put ONE link in your Instagram or Twitter bio? So annoying, right? 😫

Well, Connecte is the solution! It lets you create a super simple, cool-looking page with all your links in one spot. Your blog, your YouTube channel, your Etsy shop, your other socials... EVERYTHING! 👨‍💻👩‍🎨

Here’s what you can do with it:
- 🎨 **Make it yours:** Choose from different themes to match your vibe (we've got some cool premium themes too!).
- 📈 **See what's popular:** Find out which of your links people are clicking on the most.
- 💸 **Get supported:** Add a "Support Me" link so your followers can easily show you some love.

It’s perfect for creators, artists, small businesses, or anyone who just wants to share their stuff more easily.

I've poured a lot of love into this and would be so grateful if you checked it out and let me know what you think!
